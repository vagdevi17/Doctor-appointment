                Many STDs have minor symptoms that often go unnoticed. Other symptoms can be quite noticeable and cause a great deal of discomfort for an individual.
            </p>
            <p>
                Itching and irritation in and around the reproductive organs, as well as painful intercourse, are some common signs. Each STD has distinct symptoms that tend to characterise the disease as it progresses. To avoid the condition from worsening, it is critical to report all symptoms to a gynaecologist.
            </p>
            <p>
                STDs can cause infertility, lesions, and, in some cases, cancer if they are left untreated. It is usually recommended to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases at least once a year. The need for the test can be determined by the individual if they are in a committed relationship with only one partner.
            </p>
            <p>
                The need for STD testing is usually determined by the patient's lifestyle, the number of sexual partners they have, and whether or not they use adequate protection. STDs are not protected by birth control pills.

                If you are concerned about whether or not you have contracted an STD, you should make an appointment and get tested as soon as possible.
